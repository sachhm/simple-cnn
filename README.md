# Simple CNN
This project is an exploration into creating my own neural network using the Pytorch library. 

As of 22.01.24, Pytorch still doesn't have a version for Python 3.12, so I am using Python 3.10 in a virtual environemnt (as it comes default with Linux Mint)

please note: the cifar10 notebook is NOT MY OWN. I've copied it from the web. I forgot where
